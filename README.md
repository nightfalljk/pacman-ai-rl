# Pacman AI - Reinforcement Learning

An implementation of a Pacman AI using reinforcement learning. This project was developed during the course "Foundations of Game AI" at ITU Copenhagen. The goal was to implement a reinforcement learning model that allows Pacman to gather as many points as possible.

The implementation of the Pacman game was provided to us and is based on: https://pacmancode.com/
